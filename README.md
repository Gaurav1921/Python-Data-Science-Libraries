# Python-Data-Science-Libraries
Here I have made a Jupyter Notebook which has all the important codes for one of the two most used libraries in Data Science i.e. Numpy, Matplotlib.

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
Whereas Matplotlib is a collection of functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB.

I had taken references from YT videos of Keith Galli and along with that made my own notes on Jupyter Notebook.
